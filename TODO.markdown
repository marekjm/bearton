- improve database querying (support for tags),
- improve docs,
- create function for getting elements' metadata in a unified manner (this will ensure all required fields are always present and have default value unless overridden by `meta.json` content),

```
bearton-db index        # indexes db
bearton-page purge      # database.paths()
```
